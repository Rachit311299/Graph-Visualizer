# Graph Visualization Tool

## Description
This project is an interactive graph visualization tool built with D3.js. It allows users to input graph data, visualize the graph structure, and interact with the graph in real-time.

## Features
- Dynamic graph visualization based on user input
- Support for both directed and undirected graphs
- Interactive node dragging for custom layout
- Automatic layout using D3.js force simulation
- Real-time updates of node count
- Responsive design with boundary constraints

## How to Use
1. Input your graph data in the textarea. Each line should represent an edge, with nodes separated by a space.
   Example:
   ```
   A B
   B C
   C A
   ```
2. Choose between directed and undirected graph using the checkbox.
3. Click "Update Graph" to visualize your graph.
4. Drag nodes to adjust their positions manually.
